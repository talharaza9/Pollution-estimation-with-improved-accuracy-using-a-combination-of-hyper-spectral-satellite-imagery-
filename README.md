## Problem Statement
Hyper-spectral satellite images/data is given to extract important features to improve model along with open street map, which can be extracted for particular location using API. Problem of forecasting using satellite data only is that they are quite huge and sometimes it creates problem with respect to limited computation capacity. Challenge is to find a way to forecast feature using less satellite data and rely on other factors which are easily accessible and computational efficient. Ultimately aim is to develop a model where input will be time and location (latitude, longitude) and model gives forecasted NO2 value as output.
## Approach
This hackathon Is very challenging and interesting at the same time because we not only have to make it computationally efficient but also preserve features importance. Considering so many features for regression model, it was difficult task to develop a model that deals so huge sets of features. We divided our project into two parts. First part was data processing and compression, and second part was modelling. Data were extracted from NetCDF format using Panoply. Extracted data consisted of data for whole world. We had to extract information from that, so we made a function which captures the nearest coordinates (to coordinates given by user) and return features vector of that particular location and then converting them to data frame and then finally to array which can be used by model.
